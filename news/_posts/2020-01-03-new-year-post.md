Hello everyone and welcome to the new year and decade!

First off, we would like to introduce our new sponsors for the year.
Gold: ecoPortal, Honeywell
Silver: Serato, Sandfield, Jane Street, Atlassian, IMC Trading, Orion Health, Vista

Next up, what are our plans for 2020?

### Mixer

A good year requires a good start, and that is what the mixer is for. It allows students of all years to meet and talk with each other.

### Part II Orientation

Based on feedback we have received, and our own experiences, this event will focus more on internships this year.
BAGM 1
Industry night

### Buddy program

Started last year, we are planning on starting this again.
