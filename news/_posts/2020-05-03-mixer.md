SESA hosted its annual Mixer on Tuesday! We had a great first event of 2020, with nearly all of the Part II cohort turning up to get to know the rest of the Software Engineering students!

We had a great turnout of over 150 Software Engineering students, who mixed and mingled, and ate loads of free pizza!

We'd like to give a shoutout to our sponsors for making this event possible:
Our Gold sponsors: ecoPortal & Honeywell
Our Silver sponsors: Atlassian, IMC Trading, Jane Street, Orion Health, Sandfield, Serato & Vista
