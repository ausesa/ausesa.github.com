Hi everyone, its the end of the year, and I'd just like to make a wrap-up post to cap off this crazy year.

## Lockdown

This year, we had to do a lot of things differently because of lockdowns. Social events such as games nights and pub quizzes somehow had to be held online. Our industry events such as speed interviews was held completely online and CV checking was partially online.

Our exec have learnt a lot from these experiences and hope to carry forth some ideas from these events, such as online game nights, and allowing overseas sponsors to participate in our industry events without needing to be present in person.
