We would like to thank all our members and sponsors for making this year our most successful yet! We held 32 events over 2021, with an increased focus on collaboration and variety!

Again, we faced challenges this year, with lockdowns both at the start of the year and the end of the year. However, with experience from our last year, we rolled with the punches and hosted many events under these conditions.

This year had the most exciting and impactful changes for the club in recent memory. The logo and website (www.sesa.org.nz) was redesigned, we overhauled our marketing strategy by using Instagram and Weekly Digests to better connect with our members, and we revamped our exec team structure.

Together with WDCC, we hosted our first Hackathon! With over 130 students competing, it was the largest student-lead hackathon in NZ. 30 industry mentors attended to help support the students develop a pro-crastination invention!
