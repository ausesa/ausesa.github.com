What an awesome weekend our recent 'Make Boring Things Fun' Hackathon was with fellow club WDCC (Web Development & Consulting Club)! We were blown away with what was created over only 1 weekend!

This year's winners were:
- 1st Place: Lubricated Ducks ðŸ¥‡
- 2nd Place: Jade Jaguars ðŸ¥ˆ
- 3rd Place: Team X ðŸ¥‰
- Best Design: Infinity ^ 2
- Most Overengineered: Andrew's Angular Team

We'd like to say a huge thank you to the sponsors of both clubs for making this possible as well as Grid AKL and Red Bull for providing the space and beverages!

Another huge thank you goes to all the mentors that helped throughout the weekend!

Other photos from the event have been uploaded to a Facebook Album!

Thanks all! ðŸ’¥
