# Discord Coordinator - Sylo

We have a unique opportunity for a crypto-passionate, socially-savvy individual to join the Sylo team. A platform where many discussions around decentralised projects take place, Discord is the next frontier for Sylo as we expand our reach around the world to create a future worth looking forward to.

We’re looking for the right person to join our team and do their part in bringing our [lofty but achievable!] goals to fruition.

Do you love crypto? Do you use Discord? Are you self-motivated and reliable?

Then you might just be the right person to help us develop our Discord community.

Our ideal Discord Coordinator is a friendly, focused, human being with bucketloads of initiative and enough development knowledge to discuss all things Sylo/decentralisation/crypto/blockchain/NFTs/liquidity/nodes, AND an engaging nature that will inspire and grow our community, all while making our followers feel like they’re at home.

We are looking for not just someone who can ‘talk the talk’ but a person who genuinely appreciates crypto, blockchain, NFTs and the possibilities that these emerging technologies have to transform the world we live in.

This role could lead to further development opportunities within Sylo, so may well suit a Frontend Developer. 

**As our Discord Coordinator, you will:**
* Love all things crypto, blockchain and decentralisation!
* Assume full responsibility for day-to-day management of our presence on Discord, from responding to community members to stimulating discussions
* Generate ideas to inspire, engage and grow our Discord community
* Be consistently up to date on the latest news and developments in our space
* Contribute ideas and best practice to form the bulk of our Discord content strategy as our ‘trusted expert’
* Be reliable, self-motivated and able to stay cool under pressure
* Have great initiative and a willingness to take the logical next steps without being asked
* Speak, write and understand English at a native level
* Stay on top of the latest social media trends and weave those into your work with the community
* Contribute to other development or content activities as required

This is a competitively paid role that could be either part time or full time for the right person. Applicants must have the legal right to live and work in New Zealand.

By joining Team Sylo, you’ll become part of a ‘start up style’, close knit team that are dedicated to innovating at the ‘bleeding edge’ of decentralised technology. We have regular team social events, a flexible work from home policy, epic Christmas parties, an office pool table, and regularly like to motivate and reward our staff. There are always beers in the office fridge and often, donuts on the table! 

We are committed to rewarding those who show merit, so this is a great opportunity for a talented individual to get on board with a project quite unlike any other.
