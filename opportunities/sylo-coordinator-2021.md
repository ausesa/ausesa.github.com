# Discord Coordinator - Sylo

We have a unique job opportunity for a crypto-passionate, socially-savvy individual to join the Sylo team. A platform where many discussions around decentralised projects take place, Discord is the next frontier for Sylo as we expand our reach around the world to create a future worth looking forward to.

This is a flexible role with an ASAP start date, which can lead to part time opportunities next year, if that is what you want. This role involves building a Discord community, so if you have experience that would be a great plus!

This role can potentially contribute to your **practical work hours**.

Our ideal Discord Coordinator is a friendly, focused, human being with bucketloads of initiative and enough development knowledge to discuss all things Sylo/decentralisation/crypto/blockchain/NFTs/liquidity/nodes, AND an engaging nature that will inspire and grow our community, all while making our followers feel like they’re at home.

**As our Discord Coordinator, you will:**

-   Love all things crypto, blockchain and decentralisation!
-   Assume full responsibility for day-to-day management of our presence on Discord, from responding to community members to stimulating discussions
-   Generate ideas to inspire, engage and grow our Discord community
-   Be consistently up to date on the latest news and developments in our space
-   Contribute ideas and best practice to form the bulk of our Discord content strategy as our ‘trusted expert’
-   Be reliable, self-motivated and able to stay cool under pressure
-   Have great initiative and a willingness to take the logical next steps without being asked
-   Speak, write and understand English at a native level
-   Stay on top of the latest social media trends and weave those into your work with the community
-   Contribute to other development or content activities as required

This is a competitively paid role that could be either part time or full time for the right person. Applicants must have the legal right to live and work in New Zealand.
